Form Generator

This app is creating a set of forms from normalized data in a google spreadsheet. The code will generate a form for each tab. Currently the forms are created in your Goggle Drive root. 

Usage
(1) go to _Tools_ > _Script Editor_ and add the _Sheet2Form.gs_ file. 
(2) reload the google sheet page
(3) After a few second, you will see an additional tab called _Sheet2Form_ next to the _Help_ in your menu ribbon. 
(4) go to _Sheet2Form_ > _Export to form_
(5) once the generation is done, a pop up window will let you know. You will be able to see the forms under your google drive root.
